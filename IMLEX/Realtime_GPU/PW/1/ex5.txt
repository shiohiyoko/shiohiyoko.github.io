How to correctly process the pixels on the edges of the images?

There are multiple ways to process the pixels on the edges of the images. 
One of the ways is to linearly transform the image to the corresponding axis before the filtering process. 
This method has the advantage of using the pixel near the edge of the image, which can perform better in 
filtering the pixels on the edges compared to filling it with 0 or the referenced pixel.
